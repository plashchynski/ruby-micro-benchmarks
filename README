The Ruby micro benchmarks is a suite for measuring the performance of Ruby methods and operators.
Created in order to answer questions like what is faster array[0] or array.first, 'string' or "string", 'a: ' << a << 'b: ' << b or
"a: #{a} b: #{b}". Results of these benchmarks are sometimes unexpected and interest to optimize a performance of a program on Ruby.
